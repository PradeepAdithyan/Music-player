# Music-player
The main theme of the project is to create a music player using python which stores the address of the songs in the database and play them. We have used python along with mysql for the implementation of the project.
We have also used a otp verification for the users to login through email for which you have to enter your email id and password in the code.Any user can create an account with a respective mail id only once.
If have any trouble in sending the mail then you need to turn on "Less secure app access" in your google account security settings.
